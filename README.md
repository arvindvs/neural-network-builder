# neural-network-builder

Build a standard classifying feed-forward neural network.

Choose the size of input, number of layers, type of activation function, and number of output classes in your network.

Train your network by providing the data inputs and outputs and learning rate (uses batch gradient descent).

Use your fully trained network to perform classification!
